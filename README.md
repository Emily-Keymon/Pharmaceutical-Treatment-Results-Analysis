# Pharmaceutical Treatment Results Analysis

The goal of this project was to calculate and display various performance metrics for four pharmaceutical cancer treatments (Capomulin, Infubinol, Ketapril, Placebo) on test mice over a 45 day treatment period. Since the baseline data was provided in CSV format, Python with Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib (through Jupyter Notebooks) was used to clean and process the data, as well as calculate and display the desired outputs.

## Tasks
### Tumor Response to Treatment
1.  Import the mouse data and clinical data CSV files as individual Pandas data frames.
2.  Merge the individual data frames into a combined data frame based on the unique mouse identification numbers.
3.  Split the combined data frame into groups by treatment and time index.
4.  Calculate the average mean tumor volume for each treatment at each time index.
5.  Calculate the tumor volume standard error for each treatment at each time index.
6.  Create individual data frames for the average volume and standard error data.
7.  Plot the average volume data versus time with error bars defined by the standard error data.
